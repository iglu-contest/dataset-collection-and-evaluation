                <p>
                Give instructions to an AI agent to finish the structure!
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The hit will provide you instructions and a code for joining our Minecraft server. Once you enter the code  you will be teleported to a Minecraft world with two structures. The structure in the <b>target zone</b> you will see at your left is the structure we want to copy, and the structure in the <b>building zone</b> is a partially built starting point.</li>
                    <li>The first task is to examine both instructions and understand what changes need to be done in the starting structure to replicate the target structure.</li>
                    <li>You will start the game by giving an instruction to the agent in a chat message.
                        <ul>
                            <li>Your instructions must specify the <b>color</b> and <b>position</b> of all the blocks to place or remove.</li>
                            <li>Use positions using the cardinal points. Avoid phrases like <i>to your right</i>, instead use <i>towards West</i>.</li>
                            <li>Avoid referring to the agent's past actions, with instructions like <i>Go back</i>, <i>Remove the blocks you placed</i>. The agent has no memory.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>You will indicate your turn as finished, and the agent will try to follow the instruction.</li>
                    <li>You will repeat this process until 3 turns are completed. After this, you will finish the game. This will give you a confirmation code that validates you have played the game. YOU NEED TO PASTE THIS CODE IN THE HIT.</li>
                    <li>You will play a similar game with a second agent.</li>
                    <li>You will provide written feedback about each agent's performance .</li>
                </ul>

                <p><b>Please note that you will only get paid if you:</b></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Play at least 3 turns.</li>
                    <li>Write understandable and concise English instructions.</li>
                    <li>Copy the two valid completion codes provided by the Minecraft server into the HIT.</li>
                    <li>Click on the <b>"Submit"</b> button at the bottom.</li>
                    <li>The explained actions are in "instructions format" and  informative enough to allow someone else to complete the structure.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Preliminar question</h2>

                <p>What information IS NOT NECESSARY in the instruction to make it valid.</p>
