all the input for python_hits.py is described in `input/readme.txt`

`python_hits.p`y has the following vars now [will take var from command line later, now it's easier for testing]:

```
create_qualification_test_a = False #Tested: QT for Architect has been created, id below
create_qualification_test_b = False #Tested: QT for Builder has been created, id below
create_hits_in_production = False
get_results = False
create_hit = True 
```
Qualification Tests are created already and Ids are in comments

To test HITs keep `create_hit = True`, and change `type_hit = 'builder-normal'`
