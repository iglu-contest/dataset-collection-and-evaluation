                <p>
                Please help us instruct an imaginary builder to build a given structure in a 3-D voxel world environment. 
                You will be shown: the target structure and a partially built structure.
                You are being asked to describe in plain text, how to get from the intermediate structure towards having the final structure. 
                Please know that a builder will follow your instruction blindly without seeing a target structure and will have 45 seconds to complete the task. Make your instruction as atomic and doable as possible
                </p>
                <p>
                Imagine this is a creative game, and the builder has access to unlimited blocks of certain kinds. 
                Your goal is to get them to go from the intermediate structure to the target one in the fewest number of steps. 
                Make sure your instructions are understandable and succinct, and in English. 
                The builder will only have access to your instruction, the picture of the intermediate stage of the structure, and 45 seconds to execute the instructions.
                </p>
                <h3> Please note that you will only get paid if you: </h3>
                <ul>
                   <li> Write understandable and succinct English instructions.</li>
                   <li> The instructions you submit should help get as close to the target structure as possible.</li>
                   <li> Sometimes, the previous builder might have asked a clarifying question. 
                   You should answer the question to clarify the previous instruction so that the builder can accomplish it.</li>
                   <li>Click on "Submit" button at the bottom.</li>
                </ul>   
                <h3>Follow an example below where the target structure is:</h3>
