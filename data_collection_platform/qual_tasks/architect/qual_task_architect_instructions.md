# Qualification task for architects

## Instruct a builder to build a structure in Voxel world

Please help us instruct an imaginary builder to build a given structure in a 3-D voxel world environment.
You will be shown: the target structure and a partially built structure. You are being asked to describe in plain text,
how to get from the intermediate structure towards having the final structure. Please know that a builder will follow your instruction blindly without seeing a target structure and will have 45 seconds to complete the task. Make your instruction as atomic and doable as possible.

Imagine this is a creative game, and the builder has access to unlimited blocks of certain kinds. Your goal
is to get them to go from the intermediate structure to the target one in the fewest number of steps. 
Make sure your instructions are understandable and succinct, and in English. 
The builder will only have access to your instruction, the picture of the intermediate stage of the structure, and 45 seconds to execute 
the instructions.


**Please note that you will only get paid if you:**
1. Write understandable and succinct English instructions.
2. The instructions you submit should help get as close to the target stucture.
3. Sometimes, the previous builder might have asked a clarifying question. You should answer the question to clarify the previous instruction so that the builder can accomplish it.
4. Click on "Submit" button at the bottom.

**Few examples are explained below:**

1. For the following:
   
**Target structure** :

**Intermediate structure** :
![image](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1bvrkm-Ndfn_6xZwAI3Ugwrx735W6HtR9)

we expect you to give an instruction like: </br>
**"make a tower with yellow block at bottom, blue block on top of that and then an orange block on top"** or </br>
**"first put a yellow block on ground then place a blue block on top of it and then put an orange block on top"** 
   
2. For the following:
**Target structure** :
![image](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1TpoJ6HMRRlcLRPi3lpjEes39reZeUMS6)

**Intermediate structure**:

![image](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1HGpBWlFWAd7aU0jmlnBYeTgu6YR0Tjpf)
we expect you to give an instruction like: </br>
**"put a blue block on top of the yellow block and then put orange block on top"** or </br>
**"place two blocks on top of yellow block: blue and then orange"** 

3. For the world:
**Final state** :

**Intermediate state** :
![image](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1jWWiZDj_jiPnmbvcIIRDYwD0NShDMMe_)

we expect you to give an instruction similar to : </br>
**"place an orange block on top of the blue block"** </br>
**"place an orange block on top of the vertical tower made of yellow and blue block"** </br>

**Rejection policy: Your HIT will be rejected if any of these are violated**
1. The submitted instruction should be grammatically correct plain English.
2. The instruction should have the builder make the intermediate structure as close to the final 
   structure as possible.
