## Evaluate the architect

In this task, you will be evaluating an architect who, given the partial state of a structure gave an instruction that
a builder was expected to execute in 45 seconds. As a result, the builder 
could do one of two things: </br>
1. Build a new structure on top of the partially built structure or </br>
2. Ask a clarification question because things weren't clear.  

In this task, you are being asked to evaluate how the architect did when writing the instructions. </br>
You are asked to **evaluate the architect on a scale of 1 to 5** as explained below: </br>
**1. Very poor : The instructions written were completely incomprehensible.** </br>
**2. Poor: The instructions were grammatically correct but were very confusing or missing information.**</br>
**3. Acceptable: The instructions made sense but could be written better.**</br>
**4. Great: The instructions were very clear and needed no extra information in order to be executed.**</br>
**5. Fantastic: The instructions were very well written and clear.**</br>


### Examples
1. For example, for an architect who gave the following: </br>
**World**:

**Instruction: "place an orange block on top of the blue block"**</br>

The expected rating would be 3-5 (acceptable, great or fantastic) since the instructions were 
very clear and had one interpretation.

2. For example, for an architect who gave the following: </br>
**World**:
![image](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=13bpVlGtIjDNV7R-W5i2yeJ1Iwlbn2Bnr)

**Instruction: "place a blue block to the right of the orange block"**</br>

The expected rating would be 3, since it is not clear whether the blue block to be placed should be touching 
the orange block on its right or in the air.


3. For example, for an architect who gave the following: </br>
**World**:
![image](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=17mdYgkK0wrFaQzH0D31t24vDkdFwkM1Q)

**Instruction: "put an orange block in the space between the two blue blocks"**</br>

The expected rating would be 4 or 5 since it is very clear from the text where exactly the new 
block needs to be placed.
