Data structure contains of two main components:
1) Tables:
   - GameIds
     PartitionKey = target_structure_id
     RowKey = attempt (a sequential number to indicate an attempt)
     Timestamp
     GameId (the combination of target_structure_id and attempt generates game_id)
     Started = yes if game has been started
     Finished = yes if the game has been finished

   - HITsTable
     PartitionKey = game_id
     RowKey = HITId (from Mturk)
     Timestamp 
     StepId = step id in the game (even ones belong to builder role, odd belongs to architect role)
     structureId = target_structure_id
     attemptId (as above)
     Role = architect-normal (when architect needs to give the instruction), architect-cq (when architect needs to answer clarifying question), builder-normal (when previous instruction was clear and no clarifying questions asked), builder-cq (when previous builder asked the question)
     InputScreenshotPath = partial path to screen shots
     IsBuiltStructureComplete = if role was architect, it can be indicated that the structure is complete then the game is over
     IsHITQualified = false (if the input did not go through internal checks), and true otherwise
     WorkerId = worker id from Mturk platform
     instruction = if the role is architect, then this field shows the instruction
     views = if the role is architect, then this field represents view (south, north, east, and west) that has been picked by architect
     InputInstruction = if the role is builder, then this field shows the instruction given by architect at the previous step
     InputViews = if the role is builder, then this field shows the view picked by the architect
     IsInstructionClear = if the role is builder, this field indicates if the instruction was clear to builder
     ClarifyingQuestion = if the role is builder and the instruction is not clear
